</div>
    </div>
		<p>Once I loved <em>C</em> very much and I thought it&#8217;s the best programming language
in the world. I used to argue that <em>C</em> can be used to implement the
object-oriented design with <code>struct</code>. I used to argue that <code>private</code> and
<code>public</code> is useless in <em>C++</em>. However, now I know I was wrong.</p>

<h2>Why we need private</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s related to a very important concept in C++, that is, <strong>encapsulation</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Encapsulation is not invisibility. It&#8217;s maintainability.</strong></p>

<p>Suppose a class is very popular and is used by many projects. For example,
the <code>string</code> class. If every members in this class is <code>public</code>, the clients
can use many interfaces to manipulate <code>string</code>. One day, when the <code>string</code>
class is going to be modified(some members&#8217; name change), then lots of clients
have to modify there code. This is painful! If we declare some of the members
<code>private</code> and change the name of the private members, only the implementations
in the public member functions should be modified. None of the clients need to
change their codes.</p>

<p>Therefore, <strong>public means unchangable and public means unencapsulated</strong>.</p>

<p>The public member functions should not be changed in the future. Since you don&#8217;t
know how your clients will use your class, don&#8217;t expose the members that may be
changed in the future to the clients.</p>

<h2>Prefer non-member non-friend functions to member functions</h2>

<p>Consider the following class.</p>

<pre><code>class Person {
public:
    explicit Person()
    { }
    ~Person()
    { }
    void
    say_age() const
    { printf("%d\n", age); }
    void
    say_name() const
    { printf("%s\n", name.c_str()); }
private:
    Person(const Person&amp;);
    const Person&amp;
    operator=(const Person&amp;);
    int age;
    std::string name;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Somebody may want to use the functions together, so we add another member
function.</p>

<pre><code>class Person {
public:
    explicit Person()
    { }
    ~Person()
    { }
    void
    say_age() const
    { printf("%d\n", age); }
    void
    say_name() const
    { printf("%s\n", name.c_str()); }
    void
    say() const
    {
        say_age();
        say_name();
    }
private:
    Person(const Person&amp;);
    const Person&amp;
    operator=(const Person&amp;);
    int age;
    std::string name;
};
</code></pre>

<p>This is straightforward, especially for those Java and C# programmers. Every
functions should be in a class and everything is object. It&#8217;s obvious, right?</p>

<p>However, e have another option, that is, using the non-member function.</p>

<pre><code>class Person {
public:
    explicit Person()
    { }
    ~Person()
    { }
    void
    say_age() const
    { printf("%d\n", age); }
    void
    say_name() const
    { printf("%s\n", name.c_str()); }
private:
    Person(const Person&amp;);
    const Person&amp;
    operator=(const Person&amp;);
    int age;
    std::string name;
};

void
person_say(const Person&amp; p)
{
    p.say_age();
    p.say_name();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is better? It seems that they are the same.</p>

<p>We should use the non-member function instead of the member function.</p>

<p>As we all know, <strong>the less the public member functions and the friend </strong>
 <strong>functions, the greater encapsulation is</strong>, since member functions and
friend functions are the only interface that can access the private members.</p>

<p>In this example, if we add another public member function, we decrease the
encapsulation of the class since this member function can access the private
members of the class. But if we use the non-member non-friend function, it
won&#8217;t have impact with the class because it&#8217;s the function outside.</p>

<p>Does it explain that <em>C++</em> is not so object-oriented? From Java or C#, those
programmers will say that everything is object and classes are everywhere.
However, they are wrong. Object-oriented princiles state that <strong>data should be</strong>
<strong>encapsulated as possible</strong>. Therefore, prefering non-member non-friend
functions is more <em>object-oriented</em>.</p>

<p>Until now, I can say that I really understand the meaning of encapsulation and
why it&#8217;s so important in object-oriented programming.</p>

			Always Pass Parameters by Reference-to-const</a>

    </div>
		<p>We all know that <em>pass by value</em> is not effecient.So we use <em>pass by pointer</em>
in C.However, in C++, we prefer <strong>pass by referece-to-const</strong>.</p>

<p>Here is an example.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

class Dog {
public:
    Dog()
    {
        printf("Calling Dog's constructor\n");
    }
    Dog(const Dog&amp; d)
    {
        printf("Calling Dog's copy constructor\n");
        this-&gt;name = d.name;
    }
    virtual ~Dog()
    {
        printf("Calling Dog's destructor\n");
    }
private:
    std::string name;
};

void
walk_the_dog(Dog d)
{

}

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    Dog dog;
    walk_the_dog(dog);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The running result is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Calling Dog's constructor
Calling Dog's copy constructor
Calling Dog's destructor
Calling Dog's destructor
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s analysis this <em>passing by value</em> process.
First, <code>Dog dog;</code> will call the constructor. Then, since the function
<code>walk_the_dog</code> pass the parameter <code>d</code> by value, it will call the copy
constructor. Before exiting the function, it will call the destructor of <code>Dog</code>
to destroy the parameter <code>d</code>. In the end, before exiting the main function,
the destructor of <code>Dog</code> will be called again to destroy the <code>dog</code> object.</p>

<p>Now, it seems that <em>passing by value</em> will result in a call to copy constructor
and a call to destructor. But, in fact, it will result in two call to copy
constructor and two call to destructor. Note that there are a <code>string</code> object
as the member of the class <code>Dog</code>, so there will be an extra call the copy
constructor and destructor of the <code>string</code> object.</p>

<p>Obviously, the cost of <em>passing by value</em> is very expensive.
How is <em>passing by reference-to-const</em>?</p>

<pre><code>void
walk_the_dog(const Dog&amp; d)
{

}
</code></pre>

<p>Just modify a bit and the result will be:</p>

<pre><code>Calling Dog's constructor
Calling Dog's destructor
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>const</code> is very important. If there is not a <code>const</code>, the
compiler will put the object in the writable part of the memory so that it
cannot be shared by other functions. If declared as <code>const</code>, the object
will be put into the readonly part of the memory and can be shared by lots
of functions so that the program need less memory.</p>

<p>The implementation of reference is using the pointer in C. Therefore, it may
be more effecient to pass the built-in type parameters by value than referece.
It&#8217;s true. If the parameter is an object of type <code>char</code>, which occupies
1 byte. But a pointer ocuppies 4 bytes in a 32-bit machine. So we should prefer
passing by value when the parameter is of built-in type? No, we should always
pass the parameters by reference-to-const, since <strong>the compiler will always</strong>
<strong>put the pointer in the register!</strong></p>

<p>Finally, just remember, <strong>always pass the parameters by reference-to-const</strong>.</p>

    </div>
		<p>Today, I went to the Badaling Great Wall <strong>alone</strong>.</p>

<p>There is a saying that <strong>He who has never been to the Great Wall is not a</strong>
<strong>true man</strong>.</p>

<p>I had read this saying for many times when I was in high school, but I have
never been to the Great Wall util today.</p>

<p>I got up at 7:00am and began my tour at about 7:40am after the breakfast.
It took me 30 minutes to arrive at <em>Xi zhi men station</em> from where I live.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/pictures/13.8.3.Great-Wall-too-many-people.jpg" width="300" height="350" title="'Too many people'" ></p>

<p>I planed to take the <em>Shi jiao yan qing s2 line</em> train to the Great Wall
directly at <em>Beijing bei station</em>, which is near the <em>Xi zhi men station</em>.
However, when I arrived there, the staff of the station said that the train
will depart at 11:00am.I watched my smart phone, which showed that it&#8217;s
8:24am now.So I had to wait for about 2.5 hours if I took this train.Because
I&#8217;am those one who don&#8217;t want to stay in a place too long and want to go
somewhere to have a look, I prefer the other type of a tour.Therefore, from
the staff of the train, I knew that I could take buses to the Great Wall.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <em>Baidu Map</em>, this time I need to take the <em>line 13 train</em> and
arrive at the <em>Long ze station</em>, then take the <em>878 bus</em>.However, when I
arrived at the <em>Long ze station</em> and the <em>878 bus station</em>, I found something
almost shock me.That is, the <em>878 bus</em> only depart at 7:00am-9:00am.But my
smart phone showed that it&#8217;s 9:03am.Oh my god!But I didn&#8217;t give up.I stayed
there for another 20 minutes.This time, I almost wanted to go back home because
I looked for 10 minutes to find some bus that can go to the Great Wall and I
failed.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/pictures/13.8.3.south-wall.jpg" width="300" height="350" title="'South Wall'" ></p>

<p>I was still stubborn so that I found another way to go to the Great Wall from
<em>Baidu Map</em>.This time I went back to the <em>Xi er qi station</em>, take the
<em>Chang ping line train</em> and arrived at the final station <em>Nan shao station</em>.
When I got out of the station, I was shock again.This place is a remote village
and I can&#8217;t find a bus after looking for 10 minutes.So I went back to the
exit of the subway and ask a driver of the <em>black car</em> how much of taking me
to the Badaling Great Wall.His answer suprised me because he wanted 180 yuan.
Although I could bargin with him to reduce the price to 100 yuan, but it&#8217;s
still very very very expensive.This time I wanted to give up and went away to
find another bus station.When I got there, I found it&#8217;s excactly the bus I
could take to the Great Wall.This is the <em>870 bus</em> and then the bus didn&#8217;t
appear.Fortunately, the bus was coming soon and I got in without thinking.
That is, <strong>there is a way out for somebody</strong>.</p>

<p>After about an hour, I arrived at <em>Ni sha he station</em> and I need to change to
another bus.This time, I could take <em>919 bus</em> or the <em>879</em> bus and I felt the
Great Wall was near.After about 5 minutes, the bus comed but there were too
many people there, so I had to stand in the bus.I thought the bus will arrived
at the Great Wall no more than 20 minutes, but I never wanted to know that it&#8217;s
the most painful bus I have ever taken.I standed in the bus for more than 1.5
hours because of the traffic jam!</p>

<p>Finally I arrived at the Great Wall.</p>

<p>First, I have a lunch at <em>Yong he da wang restaurant</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/pictures/13.8.3.have-a-lunch.jpg" title="Have a lunch" alt="Have a lunch"></p>

<p>There were lots of people.But I thought there will be more in Spring and Autumn.
The photo below shows the <em>North Wall</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/pictures/13.8.3.north-wall.jpg" title="North Wall" alt="North Wall"></p>

<p>It&#8217;s obvious that I was on the south wall, and the photo below is a bird&#8217;s-eye
view of the north wall.</p>

<p><img src="/pictures/13.8.3.north-wall-bird-view.jpg" title="North Wall bird view" alt="North Wall bird view"></p>

<p>There is no doubt that I must have someone take a photo for myself.The photo
below is it, I&#8217;m not very handsome as you imaged, though.</p>

<p><img src="/pictures/13.8.3.Great-Wall-me.jpg" title="Me" alt="Me"></p>

<p>The return tour was so relax because I could take the <em>877 bus</em> to
<em>De sheng men xi station</em> directly!And it const me only 4.8 yuan.</p>

<p>In a word, although <em>the Badaling Great Wall</em> is not so <strong>great</strong> as
<em>the Palace</em>, I was still very happy today, because it&#8217;s the first time I have
a tour <strong>alone</strong>.</p>
