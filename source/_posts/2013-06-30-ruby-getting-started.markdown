Running ruby
===============

Interactive
------------
In the past, I always tested some ruby statements with ``irb``. Now I can
test a small ruby program in the following way.
    
    [monkey@itlodge octopress]$ ruby
    str = "abc"
    puts str
	Ctrl+d
    abc

After hit ``ruby``, it allows me to type as many code as possible.Finally,
press ``Ctrl+d`` will end the input and it will evaluate the code.
